# Correlation-Analysis-using-R

##[Dataset] https://data.world/data-literacy/world-bank-population-life-expectancy-urbanization/workspace/file?filename=populationlifeexpectancy.csv

##[Summary]
This project aims to see if there is a correlation between the life expectancy and the percentage of urban population in countries during the period of 2010-2017 using R. We use a dataset from the World Bank containing features such as country names, life expectancy, population etc. 

##[Features]
- "Country.Name"
- "Country.Code"            
- "Region"
- "Income.group"            
- "Year"
- "Urban.Population"        
- "Life.Expectancy.in.Years"
- "Population"

##[Variables]
- Independent: Percentage of urban population
- Dependent: Life expectancy
